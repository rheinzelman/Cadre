Procedural music through Bernoulli Percolation:
Have a N by N grid, each node connected by an edge in a grid pattern.
Each edge has a uniformly random weight between 0 and 1.
There is a value p, that gradually increases from 0 to 1.
When p is greater than the weight of an edge, that edge is removed.

One idea to extend this to music is to map each node to a certain note, and each edge to a certain interval.
When an edge is removed, the interval is no longer played.

Another idea is to map each node to a note, and when an edge is removed from that node, the note is played. This would be more like a melody.

One last idea to map bernoulli percolation to music is to map each node to a chord, and each edge to a note. When an edge is removed, the note is played. When all edges are removed from a node, the chord is played. This would be like playing chords over a melody.
